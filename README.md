# PowerBI-SupplyChain-InventoryManagement

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating an advanced Inventory Management Dashboard using Power BI. It is designed to assist Warehouse and In-plant Inventory Managers in effectively controlling inventory levels and maintaining service levels.

## Key Features

### 1. ABC Inventory Classification
- **ABC Analysis:** Classifies inventory into three categories (A, B, and C) based on their importance and contribution to overall value.
- **Pareto Principle Application:** Ensures that High valued items **(A)** receive the most attention, while less valued items **(C)** receive the least.

### 2. XYZ Classification
- **XYZ Analysis:** Categorizes items based on their usage patterns and variability in demand where **(X)** is the Uniform demand and **(Z)** is Uncertain demand.
- **Demand Stability Insight:** Helps in understanding which items have consistent demand and which do not.

### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio
- **Turnover Calculation:** Provides insights into how often inventory is sold and replaced over a period.
- **Efficiency Metrics:** Helps managers understand the efficiency of inventory management practices.

### 4. Calculation of Safety Stock & Reorder Points
- **Safety Stock Calculation:** Determines the optimal level of extra inventory to minimize the risk of stockouts.
- **Reorder Point Determination:** Identifies the ideal time to reorder stock to maintain inventory levels and service quality.

### 5. Stock Status Classification
- **Stock Status Categories:** Classifies inventory into various status categories (e.g., in-stock, out-of-stock, overstocked).
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time updates on stock status to facilitate quick decision-making.

### 6. ABC Pareto Chart
- **Visual Analysis:** Uses Pareto charts to visually represent the ABC classification, highlighting the most important items.
- **Data-driven Decisions:** Aids in making informed decisions based on visual data representation.

### 7. Demand Forecasting
- **Forecast Models:** Implements various forecasting models to predict future inventory needs.
- **Proactive Planning:** Allows managers to plan ahead and maintain optimal inventory levels based on demand forecasts.

## Benefits for Inventory Managers
- **Effective Inventory Control:** Provides tools and insights to manage inventory levels effectively.
- **Service Level Maintenance:** Helps in maintaining high service levels by ensuring the availability of critical inventory items.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Empowers managers with data-driven insights for better decision-making.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Enhances operational efficiency by reducing stockouts and overstock situations.

## How to Use
1. **Data Integration:** Integrate your inventory data with the Power BI dashboard.
2. **Dashboard Customization:** Customize the dashboard parameters to fit your specific needs.
3. **Real-time Monitoring:** Use the dashboard to monitor inventory status and make informed decisions.
4. **Forecasting:** Utilize the demand forecasting feature to plan for future inventory needs.

## Conclusion
This Power BI Inventory Management Dashboard is an essential tool for Warehouse and In-plant Inventory Managers. By leveraging advanced classification techniques, turnover ratios, safety stock calculations, and demand forecasting, it provides comprehensive insights and aids in effective inventory management.
